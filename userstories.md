As a developer, I want my basic development environment to be the same across
platforms so that I can focus on learning how to use one set of tools.

As a developer for Windows-based users, I want to execute files that have to 
run under Windows so that I can test what I'm developing.

As a developer, I want to work in a Linux environment so that I gain
experience with open-source tools that work everywhere.

As a developer, I want to be able to edit files on a host's filesystem
directly, so that I can avoid file duplication.

As a developer, I want my environment to be ready to go after a single command,
so that I don't need to reconfigure it each time I get a new machine.

As a developer, I want to start with training wheels-style solutions to the
configuration bootstrapping problem, so that I can stop working on this repo
and work on real things.
