* Add Node.js and the tldr package
* Switch guest OS to Arch
  - *Why?* Because always getting the newest version of tmux shouldn't require
    updating my OS, building from source, or installing from some random
    person's development package archive.
* Add ranger.
* Go hard (dwm, dvtm, dtach/abduco).
* Yank tmux scrollback in vim? I think dvtm does that.
* Segregate packages into parts, eg. base, devel, rec (only if size becomes an issue).
* Add playbook item that removes unused packages, look at apt-get subcommands
