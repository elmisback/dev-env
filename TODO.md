* dwm, dvtm, dtach/abduco.
* Add htop and maybe ranger.
* Yank tmux scrollback in vim? I think dvtm does that.
* Segregate packages into parts, eg. base, devel, rec (only if size becomes an issue).
* Add playbook item that removes unused packages, look at apt-get subcommands
* Add Node.js and the tldr package
